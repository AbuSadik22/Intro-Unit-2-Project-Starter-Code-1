It can lead to other issues such as low literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, and so on. Due to a lack of money, a poor person is unable to obtain an education and therefore remains unemployed. And, Poor people are more likely to have several kinds of health problems. </h2>

    <h1> Impact of poverty on society </h1>
  </div>
  <h2>When a large number of people cannot afford to purchase goods and services, economic growth is more difficult to achieve. Second, poverty produces crime and other social problems that have an impact on people at all socioeconomic levels. Children growing up in poverty are less likely to graduate from high school or go to college, and they are more likely to commit street crime. As a result, the rate of crime in society increases, and without education, some people leave without having a job and become unemployed, which can lead to having disastrous effects on economic growth.</h2>

    <h1> Solutions to Poverty </h1>
  </div>
  <h2>Poverty has an effect on a lot of people. They are mostly low-income individuals. Rich countries should cooperate together to aid poor nations in the fight against poverty. Millions of people worldwide die as a result of poverty. Children in poor countries suffer from malnutrition due to a lack of food. Providing all people with access to basic social services, including education, health care, adequate food, sanitation, shelter, and clean water, could reduce global poverty problems.
